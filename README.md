# AC-iOS-ThreeCardMonteExercise


Welcome Developers!!

## Overview

Randomize three cards made from UIButtons. 

When the user selects the winning card, the King, tell the user they have won. 

When the user selects the incorrect card, reveal the card they picked and the King. Tell the user they lost.  Include a new game button that returns the cards to the face-down position. 

Your final app should look like the gif below. 


### Level 1: 

Create three buttons. If the user selects the first button on the right then tell the user they won. If the user selects any other button, then display to the user they lose. 

After a user clicks on a button, disable all buttons until the new game button is pressed. Reset the text to an introductory message.

### Level 2: 

Make the winning button be randomly selected.


### Level 3: 

Add images to the button to make them look like cards. Build the app to look like the example.

### Level 4: 

Add a label that saves the users score.
